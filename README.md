This is the beautiful game developed by me in C++ in Microsoft Visual Studio 2015 with the help of SDL2 libraries.

By some mistake I have misplaced my main screen file in this game so i m not able to upload that. But in the future i will surely upload that part as well because I need to redisgn it again.
Or most probably I will make it in Pygame in Python
